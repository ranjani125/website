        title: "Machine Learning and Data Science",
        info: "I am interested in machine learning and its applications, especially in areas outside computer science. Solving real-world problems through recent methods in ML excites me. In addition, I am interested in theoretical ML dealing with the math behind the scenes. I also enjoy extracting insights from data, and working with feature extraction/transformation."

        title: "Deep Learning",
        info: "Computer vision and designing architectures for various deep learning problems is another of my research interests. Examples of papers I loved are \"Delving Deep Into Rectifiers: Surpassing Human-Level Performance on ImageNet Classification\" and \"The One Hundred Layers Tiramisu: Fully Convolutional DenseNets for Semantic Segmentation\"."

    {
        title: "Computational Neuroscience",
        info: "I am particularly interested in network models, predictive coding models, and modeling V1 and the rest of the visual cortex. I would also love to work on reconstructive models, such as Nishimoto et al., 2011."

        title: "Computational Social Science",
        info: "I am interested in applying statistical inference methods to sociology and social networks. This includes topics such as modeling the spread of information in a network."

        title: "Educational Data Mining",
        info: "While this may belong under ML, I realize this has been recognized as a separate research area. I am particularly interested in computer science education research. I was especially fascinated by the simplicity of the Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) model and its extensions, such as the Intervention-BKT (Lin & Chi, 2016)."

        title: "Affective Computing",
        info: "More than as an individual field of research, I am interested in incorporating affect in other machine learning models. One example of this is the Knowledge and Affect Tracing (KAT) model (Schultz & Arroyo, 2014)."
