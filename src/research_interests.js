        title: "ML and Data Science",
        info: "I am interested in machine learning and its applications, especially in areas outside computer science. Solving real-world problems through recent methods in ML excites me. In addition, I am interested in theoretical ML dealing with the math behind the scenes. I also enjoy extracting insights from data, and working with feature extraction/transformation."

        title: "Deep Learning",
        info: "Computer vision and designing architectures for various deep learning problems is another of my research interests. Examples of papers I loved are \"Delving Deep Into Rectifiers: Surpassing Human-Level Performance on ImageNet Classification\" and \"The One Hundred Layers Tiramisu: Fully Convolutional DenseNets for Semantic Segmentation\"."

        title: "Educational Data Mining",
        info: "While this may belong under ML, I realize this has been recognized as a separate research area. I am particularly interested in computer science education research. I was especially fascinated by the simplicity of the Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) model and its extensions, such as the Intervention-BKT (Lin & Chi, 2016)."
