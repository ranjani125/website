                    Since water is most of coffee, it is important to check its quality. I luckily live in a <a href="https://raleighnc.gov/services/content/PubUtilAdmin/Articles/WaterQualityReports.html#paragraph--222826">soft water area</a>, so a Brita filter usually suffices.

                    My current favorite coffee is <a href="https://counterculturecoffee.com/shop/coffee/la-golondrina">La Golondrina by Counter Culture</a>.

                    I moved from a cheap <a href="https://www.amazon.com/KRUPS-Electric-Coffee-Grinder-Stainless/dp/B00004SPEU">blade grinder</a>, to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hario-Ceramic-Coffee-Mill-Mini-Slim/dp/B01GPMH590">Hario Mini-Slim Plus</a>, and now use a <a href="https://baratza.com/grinder/encore/">Baratza Encore</a>.
                    I find I like a 65g/L ratio, so I grind 13.1g to account for retention and brew with 200mL of water (I do not know what that is in imperial units).

                    I moved from my <a href="https://www.bodum.com/us/en/10685-kenya">French Press</a> to my <a href="https://aeropress.com/product/aeropress-coffee-maker/">AeroPress</a>, to a V60. I use 95C water, at 60g/L using a medium-fine grind (17 on my Encore) with the Hoffmann method. I'm quite satisfied with this brew, and haven't tinkered more.
