                    Since water is most of coffee, it is important to check its quality. I luckily live in a <a href="https://raleighnc.gov/services/content/PubUtilAdmin/Articles/WaterQualityReports.html#paragraph--222826">soft water area</a>, so a Brita filter usually suffices.
                    However, I will sometimes add a few drops of a 2g/L solution of sodium bicarbonate (in distilled water) if I feel my coffee is sour, but the rest of my brewing process was good.

                    I moved from a cheap <a href="https://www.amazon.com/KRUPS-Electric-Coffee-Grinder-Stainless/dp/B00004SPEU">blade grinder</a>, to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hario-Ceramic-Coffee-Mill-Mini-Slim/dp/B01GPMH590">Hario Mini-Slim Plus</a>, and now use a <a href="https://baratza.com/grinder/encore/">Baratza Encore</a>.
                    I find I like a 65g/L ratio, so I grind 13.1g to account for retention and brew with 200mL of water (I do not know what that is in imperial units).

                    I moved from my <a href="https://www.bodum.com/us/en/10685-kenya">French Press</a> to my <a href="https://aeropress.com/product/aeropress-coffee-maker/">AeroPress</a>. I use water 20 seconds off boil, at 65g/L using a medium-fine grind (7 clicks on my Hario Mini Mill), inverted with a 5-second stir and a 1m 15s brew. I'm quite satisfied with this brew, and haven't tinkered more.
